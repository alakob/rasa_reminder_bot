      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Twilio integration task into subtasks covering API setup, notification service implementation, scheduling mechanism, and error handling with testing scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "External API integration with Twilio requires careful configuration and error handling. The scheduling component adds complexity, though the API itself is well-documented."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Time Zone Handling",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the time zone handling implementation into subtasks covering conversion utilities, user preference management, entity extraction enhancement, and fallback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Time zone handling is deceptively complex, requiring careful implementation of conversion logic, storage strategies, and user preference management. The entity extraction enhancement adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Multi-Channel Support",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the multi-channel support configuration into subtasks covering individual channel setup, message formatting, user identification across channels, and webhook management.",
      "reasoning": "Supporting multiple channels requires specific configuration for each platform, handling different message formats, and maintaining user context across channels. The webhook setup and cross-channel recognition add complexity."
